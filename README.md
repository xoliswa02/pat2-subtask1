# Morse Code Research

## Overview

Morse code is a method of transmitting textual information using a series of dots (.) and dashes (-), which represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. It is typically used in telecommunication and was historically transmitted using sound, light, or visual signals.

## Historical Context

Morse code was developed in the 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for use with the electric telegraph. It allowed operators to send messages quickly over long distances. It played a significant role in early communication technology, especially in military and maritime operations.

## How Morse Code Works

Each letter and number is represented by a unique combination of short signals (dots) and long signals (dashes). For example:
- A = .-
- B = -...
- C = -.-.
- 1 = .----
- 2 = ..---

Spaces are used to separate individual letters and words. The system is designed so that the most commonly used letters (like E and T) have the shortest codes, improving efficiency.

## Examples of Words in Morse Code

- **HELLO** = .... . .-.. .-.. ---
- **WORLD** = .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
- **MORSE** = -- --- .-. ... .
- **CODE** = -.-. --- -.. .
